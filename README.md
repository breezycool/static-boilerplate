## Static Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate I wrote because I couldn't wrap my head around all the components included in most Yeoman/Brunch boilerplates, and also to help me become a little more intimate with Gulp. 

# Technologies
- Jade
- Foundation/Sass
- CoffeeScript
- Gulp
- BrowserSync (for auto-refresh and stats)

# Install
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

# Run
`gulp`, or `gulp serve`

# Adding Libraries
I've added jQuery and bounce.js to demonstrate how to add libraries. Just download the library using `bower install`, and then add the path to the list in the libraries task in gulpfile.js
